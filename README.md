# Simple HTTP client
Small HTTP client with GUI writen in Java.
Can send hand-written requests and display responses (like netcat) and help to generate requests.
Requests are generated as
```
METHOD + URL.Path + HTTP/1.1
headers (Host and Content-length added automatically)

body (if method is POST or PUT)
```
